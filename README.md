Basic intro to project-
1.This is a captcha solver neural network project in python which predicts the given captcha image.
2.This model 93 percent accuracy.
3. Used google collab platform to code the project
4.model_train.ipynb file contains the code of neural network structure and training 
5.model_test.ipynb file contains code which predict the given input captcha image
6.train NN.h5 is our final trained model
